### OBJECTIVE: ###
- Primary Objective
  - To gain practical experience by modeling a database based on real world problem.
  - To understand how to work on Back-end (MySQL).
- Secondary Objective 
  - To develop the easy management of the medicines (drugs).
  - To handle the inventory details like sales details, purchase details and stock expiry and quantity.
  - To provide competitive advantage to the pharmacy.
  - To provide details information about the stock on details necessary and help locate it in shop easily.
  - To make the stock manageable and simplify the use of inventory in the pharmacy.

### HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TOOLS: ###
The system services and goals are established by consultation with system user. They are then defined in details and serve as a system specification. System requirement are those on which the system runs.


‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Requirements:
- Computer with either Intel Pentium processor or AMD processor.
- 1GB+ DDR RAM
- 40GB hard disk drive

üíª Software Requirements:
- Windows/ MacOS/ Linux operating system.
- MySQL server (WAMP or XAMPP or any)

## DESIGN ##
Database Design is a collection of processes that facilitate the designing, development, implementation and maintenance of enterprise data management systems.
It helps produce database systems:
* That meet the requirements of the users.
* Have high performance.

### Architecture Description ###
The design of a DBMS depends on its architecture. It can be centralized or decentralized or hierarchical. The architecture of a DBMS can be seen as either single tier or multi-tier.
